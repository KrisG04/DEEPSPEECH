## Background Work

### Objectives

* [x] Review Speaker Diarization Models
* [x] Explore Existing Implementations

### Speaker Diarization Models

* [Robust Speaker Diarization For Meetings](http://www.xavieranguera.com/phdthesis/PhD_Thesis.html)
* [Speaker Segmentation and Clustering in Meetings](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/910b/3d2fe351188d69007d82457e13c210ba9574.pdf)

### LIUM

* [LIUM SPKDIARIZATION: An Open Source Toolkit for Diarization](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/lib/exe/fetch.php/diarization-cmu-spud-2010.pdf)
* [An Open-source State-of-the-art Toolbox for Broadcast News Diarization](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/lib/exe/fetch.php/toolkit-interspeech2013.pdf)

## Implementation

### Objectives

* [x] Run State-of-the-Art Diarization Models

### Speakers in the Wild 15s Sample

* Duration: ~15s
* Number of Speakers: 2
* Speaker Overlap: no
* File: ../data/SpeakersInTheWild/dev/audio/abcsp.flac
* Section: starts at 37s
* Manual Diarization:
	* Speaker1: [0s, 6s]
	* Speaker2: [7s, 15s]
* LIUM Diarization Output:

		sample15 1 0 556 M S U S0
		sample15 1 556 942 M S U S1

* Interpretation:
	* Speaker1: [0s, 5.56s]
	* Speaker2: [5.56s, 15s]

### Speakers in the Wild 60s Sample

* Duration: ~60s
* Number of Speakers: 2
* Speaker Overlap: yes
* File: ../data/SpeakersInTheWild/dev/audio/abcsp.flac
* Section: starts at 0s
* Manual Diarization:
	* Speaker1: [0s, 14s], [22s, 23s], [24s, 27s], [31s, 43s]
	* Speaker2: [14s, 17s], [19s, 22s], [44s, 60s]
	* Overlaps: [17s, 19s], [23s, 24s], [27s, 31s]
* LIUM Diarization Output:

		sample60 1 0 1431 M S U S0
		sample60 1 3081 1174 M S U S0
		sample60 1 1431 1650 M S U S2
		sample60 1 4255 1743 M S U S7

* Interpretation:
	* Speaker1: [0s, 14.31s], [30.81s, 42.55s]
	* Speaker2: [14.31s, 30.81s]
	* Speaker3: [42.55s, 60s]
