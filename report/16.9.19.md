## Experimentation

### Objectives

* [x] Analyze the Corpus

###  Speakers in the Wild ASR Corpus

#### General Observations

* Recordings are in non studio conditions, including background noise
* Clips are relatively long, often lasting several minutes
* Clips sometimes contain multiple speakers, often speaking together
* Speaker identification data is included
* Text to speech annotation is not included

#### Preprocessing Parameters

* MFCC size: 50
* Hop Length: 700

#### Dev

* Total Number of Samples: 1958
* Maximum Length along Time Axis: 7718
* Number of Samples with:
	* 1 Speaker: 823 (119 distinct speaker IDs)
	* 2 Speakers: 521 (119 distinct speaker IDs)
	* 3 Speakers: 135 (81 distinct spaker IDs)
